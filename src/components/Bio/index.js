            <p>Hi there! My name is Brent! I'm a budding, 24-year-old developer whose main goal is to constantly learn and improve. I'm originally from Central Illinois, but moved to Atlanta, Georgia in 2019 to start a new life.</p>
            <p>Having originally studied ancient history and languages, I am now spending time learning computer programming languages. The work is hard, but the reward is great and I am constantly finding reasons to keep getting excited about it.</p>
            <p>Below are some links to projects I've worked on. I will continue to update this portfolio page with more interactivity and more projects!</p>
